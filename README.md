# P4SSG3N
This is a password generator that is fully programmed in Python. I had used PyInstaller To Convert it into an windows program "exe". For some reasxon the "exe" if flagged as "malicious" when it is not. If you do not wish do use the "exe" version feel free to use the python version instead, and if you also want to see that it is not malicious aswell install pyinstaller convert the python file into a "exe" and watch it get caught by win defender. "When the shittest antivirus finnaly pics up a file but when you notice its not even malicious ðŸ˜‚" - MalwareMix


## HOW TO INSTALL

```console
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/MalwareMix/P4SSG3N.git

# change the working directory to P4SSG3N
$ cd P4SSG3N

# install the requirements
$ pip install colorama
You only need to install colorama if you are runing the python file!
If you want to use the windows "exe" file make sure to turn off windows defender because it picks up as "malicious" when it's not. If you want to test if it does
install "pyinstaller" then converte to exe and you can see for yourself that it picks up thus me quote in the begining ðŸ˜‚

V1.1 Came Out 5/29/2021 Just made it standalone used "nuitka" to convert it and add a icon. Now windows defender does not say it is "malicious" and now we have one less pain in the ass
